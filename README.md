# Data Tools and Algorithms Coursework

This repository features coursework and projects completed for my **Data Tools and Algorithms** class at Brooklyn College.

In this course, I learned how to utilize python programming for data acquisition, analysis, and visualization. I worked extensively with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and scikit-learn to manipulate and explore datasets. Topics covered include core data algorithms such as clustering. I also gained foundational knowledge in using machine learning techniques to make predictions from data.

Key highlights of the course:
- **Data acquisition and cleaning** using Python's powerful libraries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Algorithmic thinking**: Implementing clustering, ranking, and network-based algorithms.
- **Dimensionality reduction** and **feature engineering**.
- **Introductory machine learning** concepts, including k-means clustering and k-nearest neighbors.
- **Visualization of complex data** to derive meaningful insights.
- **Ethical considerations** in data science.

The course emphasized practical, hands-on learning, culminating in a capstone data analysis project where I selected a dataset and applied a range of techniques learned throughout the semester. Coursework was based on readings from the *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas and supplemented by *Data Science from Scratch* by Joel Grus.

This repository includes:
- Homework assignments
- Data analysis project
